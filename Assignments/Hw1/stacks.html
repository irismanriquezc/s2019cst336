            Stacks are a type of container designed specifically to perform in a LIFO context( last- in first- out),
            where components are placed and extracted from only one end of the container.
            <br/><br/>
            Stack can be implemented quickly with an array or a linked list. Arrays are fast, but limited in size
            and Linked Lists involves overhead to be allocated, linked, unlinked and distributed, but not limited 
            in size. 

            <br/><br/>
            There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one 
            another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the 
            plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time.

           Some functions that stacks have are: 
            <ul>
                <li> <span class="func">.pop():</span> pops the top element </li>
                <li> <span class="func">.push():</span> pushes element into stack </li>
                <li> <span class="func">.top():</span> accesses next element</li>
                <li> <span class="func">.empty():</span> checks if stack is empty</li>
                <li> <span class="func">.size():</span> returns the size of stack </li>
               
               
            </ul>
